Genders of the children are clubbed based on the order of birth. They could range from either male-male, male-female, female-male or female-female.\nhavemorekids: Factor indicating whether the mother has more than 2 children.\nethnicity: Factor indicating the ethnicity of the mother. The ethnicity can be either Caucasian, Hispanic, AFAM (African American), other (ethinicities other than the ones mentioned), AFAM+Hispanic, AFAM+Other or Hispanic+Other.\n\nQuantitative Variables\n\nmother_age: age of the mother in years.\nwork_weeks: number of weeks the mother worked in the year 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes having more kids correlate with working fewer weeks?\nDoes the gender of the 2 existing children play a role in having a third child?\nDo ethnicities differ in average weeks worked?\nAt what ages is work participation highest/lowest?\nAre non-working mothers clustered by age, ethnicity, or whether or not they have more than 2 children?\nDo “mixed ethnicity” mothers show a different pattern?\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

Access to healthcare/ income/societal/personal factors could also play a role on them having 2 children and not more.\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_props(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~havemorekids,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Mothers Having 2 or More Children\",\n    subtitle = \"Data across different ethnicities, by proportion\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Caucasian” and “Other” ethnicities seem to comprise of the most number of mothers with only 2 children, compared to “Hispanic + Other”, which has most number of mothers with more than 2 children.\nHow does sex education/ access to healthcare play a role here, across ethnicities?\nDoes the gender of the 2 existing children play a role in having a third child?\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  gf_props(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~havemorekids) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n    subtitle = \"Data showing presence of 2 or more children, by proportion\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s plot a better graph, one with position=dodge to understand the child preferences better.\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~havemorekids) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n          subtitle=\"Data showing presence of 2 or more children\") %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s make a graph, faceting it by ethnicities, apart from caucasians, to understand the other ethnicities better:\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  filter(ethnicity!=\"Caucasian\") %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~havemorekids,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~ethnicity) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n          subtitle=\"Data showing presence of 2 or more children\") %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome!\nThe data suggests that the decision to have a third child is not simply based on whether the parents already have a daughter/son, but rather on whether their existing children are of the same gender(male-male/female-female). Parents with two children of the same gender are more likely to go on to have a third child, possibly driven by the hope of “balancing” genders within the family. And also families who already have both a male and a female child (a “balanced” gender ratio) are less likely to have more children.\nThis pattern negates our assumption of there being a subtle form of gender bias/sexism, where the female-female combination is more strongly associated with trying for another child, reflecting a cultural preference for sons.\nOur assumption however, is still seen in the “Other” ethnicity, suggesting that our hypothesis is not merely an assumption.\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_histogram(~work_weeks | havemorekids ) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title= \"Distribution of Work Weeks Among Mothers\",\n          subtitle= \"Who has more children?\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMothers who are not employed (0 weeks of work in a year) make up the majority in both the histograms.\nBoth histograms also show a spike among mothers who work full-time. This could suggest that these mothers need to support their families financially, possibly as single parents - or that they are ambitious and committed to maintaining their careers while raising children.\nOne possible interpretation is that mothers with more children may need to work more in order to provide for them. However, the data also shows that many working mothers tend to stop having children at two children, as do mothers who are not working at all.\nThis leads us to questioning:\nWhy do some mothers choose not to have more than two children regardless of their work status?\nDo mothers stop working after having more than two children because childcare demands leave them with little time for employment, or are they unable to continue working due to the increased motherly responsibilities?\nDo factors like age, ethnicity also play a role in such decisions?\n\n\n\nThe summary below shows us the distribution of ages of mothers with 2 or more children.\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(mean_mother_age= mean(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    sd_mother_age = sd(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    min_mother_age = min(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    max_mother_age = max(mother_age, na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  mean_mother_age sd_mother_age min_mother_age max_mother_age\n            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            30.4          3.39             21             35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n\n  group_by(ethnicity) %&gt;% \n   dplyr::summarise(mean_mother_age= mean(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    sd_mother_age = sd(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    min_mother_age = min(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    max_mother_age = max(mother_age, na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  ethnicity      mean_mother_age sd_mother_age min_mother_age max_mother_age\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFAM                      29.9          3.52             21             35\n2 AFAM+Hispanic             30.0          3.60             22             35\n3 Caucasian                 30.5          3.34             21             35\n4 Hispanic                  29.9          3.63             21             35\n5 Hispanic+Other            29.2          3.71             21             35\n6 Other                     30.7          3.26             21             35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  group_by(ethnicity) %&gt;% \n dplyr::summarise(\n    mean_work_weeks = mean(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    sd_work_weeks = sd(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    min_work_weeks = min(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    max_work_weeks = max(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    \n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  ethnicity      mean_work_weeks sd_work_weeks min_work_weeks max_work_weeks\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFAM                      29.2          22.4              0             52\n2 AFAM+Hispanic             22.4          23.2              0             52\n3 Caucasian                 18.4          21.7              0             52\n4 Hispanic                  18.1          21.7              0             52\n5 Hispanic+Other            18.3          21.5              0             52\n6 Other                     21.4          22.8              0             52\n\n\nAfrican American (AFAM) women tend to work more on average (around 29 weeks a year) compared to other ethnicities. One of the factors contributing to this could be the greater economic or social pressures that their community has to face that make continuous participation in the labor market less of a choice and more of a necessity.\nHispanic and Caucasian women record the lowest mean number of work weeks (18.06 and 18.4, respectively).\nSimilarly, other hypotheses could be:\n\nA possible explanation is that Hispanic women may benefit from joint-family like support systems, allowing them to focus less on paid work while still managing household responsibilities.\nCaucasian women, on the other hand, may be less likely to head single-parent households, and also, the fact that Caucasian men tend to earn higher wages compared to other ethnic groups, there may be less financial necessity for them to engage in consistent employment.\nDo cultural norms and socioeconomic positioning shape women’s participation in the labor force?\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  gf_boxplot(ethnicity~mother_age,

at different average ages:\n\nMothers in the Hispanic+Other category have children at more diverse ages, some quite young, some much older.\nIn contrast, groups like Other have narrower boxes, meaning most mothers fall within a smaller, tighter age range.\nHispanic and Hispanic + Other mothers seem to have slightly younger distributions compared to Caucasian or AFAM mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrosstable(mother_age + work_weeks ~ havemorekids+children_gender + ethnicity,\n  data = Fertility_2\n) %&gt;%\n

participation in the workforce are shaped by many overlapping factors such as age, ethnicity, family structure, and cultural norms.\nMost mothers in this data set stop at two children, but those who go on to have more tend to be slightly older and often show differences in their work participation.\nEthnicity also matters: African American mothers work more weeks on average, while Hispanic and Caucasian mothers record fewer weeks, suggesting different economic pressures and support systems.\nThe gender of existing children also plays a role, with families who already have two children of the same sex more likely to have a third, reflecting a desire for balance rather than a clear gender bias.\nAre cultural expectations or financial needs the main reason why mothers stop at two children or choose to have more?\nTill what extent are their work choices voluntary, and till what extent are they shaped by inequalities in childcare, wages, and access to healthcare?\nMost importantly: What do these findings tell us about the everyday trade-offs mothers make between personal goals, cultural traditions, and the social systems around them?"

Access to healthcare/ income/societal/personal factors could also play a role on them having 2 children and not more.\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_props(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~havemorekids,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Mothers Having 2 or More Children\",\n    subtitle = \"Data across different ethnicities, by proportion\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Caucasian” and “Other” ethnicities seem to comprise of the most number of mothers with only 2 children, compared to “Hispanic + Other”, which has most number of mothers with more than 2 children.\nHow does sex education/ access to healthcare play a role here, across ethnicities?\nDoes the gender of the 2 existing children play a role in having a third child?\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  gf_props(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~havemorekids) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n    subtitle = \"Data showing presence of 2 or more children, by proportion\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s plot a better graph, one with position=dodge to understand the child preferences better.\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_bar(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~havemorekids) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n          subtitle=\"Data showing presence of 2 or more children\") %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s make a graph, faceting it by ethnicities, apart from caucasians, to understand the other ethnicities better:\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  filter(ethnicity!=\"Caucasian\") %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~havemorekids,\n    fill = ~children_gender,\n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(~ethnicity) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Gender Combinations of Children Across Ethnicities\",\n          subtitle=\"Data showing presence of 2 or more children\") %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome!\nThe data suggests that the decision to have a third child is not simply based on whether the parents already have a daughter/son, but rather on whether their existing children are of the same gender(male-male/female-female). Parents with two children of the same gender are more likely to go on to have a third child, possibly driven by the hope of “balancing” genders within the family. And also families who already have both a male and a female child (a “balanced” gender ratio) are less likely to have more children.\nThis pattern negates our assumption of there being a subtle form of gender bias/sexism, where the female-female combination is more strongly associated with trying for another child, reflecting a cultural preference for sons.\nOur assumption however, is still seen in the “Other” ethnicity, suggesting that our hypothesis is not merely an assumption.\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;%\n  gf_histogram(~work_weeks | havemorekids ) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title= \"Distribution of Work Weeks Among Mothers\",\n          subtitle= \"Who has more children?\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

This could suggest that these mothers need to support their families financially, possibly as single parents - or that they are ambitious and committed to maintaining their careers while raising children.\nOne possible interpretation is that mothers with more children may need to work more in order to provide for them. However, the data also shows that many working mothers tend to stop having children at two children, as do mothers who are not working at all.\nThis leads us to questioning:\nWhy do some mothers choose not to have more than two children regardless of their work status?\nDo mothers stop working after having more than two children because childcare demands leave them with little time for employment, or are they unable to continue working due to the increased motherly responsibilities?\nDo factors like age, ethnicity also play a role in such decisions?\n\n\n\nThe summary below shows us the distribution of ages of mothers with 2 or more children.\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(mean_mother_age= mean(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    sd_mother_age = sd(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    min_mother_age = min(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    max_mother_age = max(mother_age, na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  mean_mother_age sd_mother_age min_mother_age max_mother_age\n            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            30.4          3.39             21             35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n\n  group_by(ethnicity) %&gt;% \n   dplyr::summarise(mean_mother_age= mean(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    sd_mother_age = sd(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    min_mother_age = min(mother_age, na.rm=T),\n    max_mother_age = max(mother_age, na.rm=T))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  ethnicity      mean_mother_age sd_mother_age min_mother_age max_mother_age\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFAM                      29.9          3.52             21             35\n2 AFAM+Hispanic             30.0          3.60             22             35\n3 Caucasian                 30.5          3.34             21             35\n4 Hispanic                  29.9          3.63             21             35\n5 Hispanic+Other            29.2          3.71             21             35\n6 Other                     30.7          3.26             21             35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  group_by(ethnicity) %&gt;% \n dplyr::summarise(\n    mean_work_weeks = mean(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    sd_work_weeks = sd(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    min_work_weeks = min(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    max_work_weeks = max(work_weeks, na.rm=T),\n    \n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  ethnicity      mean_work_weeks sd_work_weeks min_work_weeks max_work_weeks\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFAM                      29.2          22.4              0             52\n2 AFAM+Hispanic             22.4          23.2              0             52\n3 Caucasian                 18.4          21.7              0             52\n4 Hispanic                  18.1          21.7              0             52\n5 Hispanic+Other            18.3          21.5              0             52\n6 Other                     21.4          22.8              0             52\n\n\nAfrican American (AFAM) women tend to work more on average (around 29 weeks a year) compared to other ethnicities. One of the factors contributing to this could be the greater economic or social pressures that their community has to face that make continuous participation in the labor market less of a choice and more of a necessity.\nHispanic and Caucasian women record the lowest mean number of work weeks (18.06 and 18.4, respectively).\nSimilarly, other hypotheses could be:\n\nA possible explanation is that Hispanic women may benefit from joint-family like support systems, allowing them to focus less on paid work while still managing household responsibilities.\nCaucasian women, on the other hand, may be less likely to head single-parent households, and also, the fact that Caucasian men tend to earn higher wages compared to other ethnic groups, there may be less financial necessity for them to engage in consistent employment.\nDo cultural norms and socioeconomic positioning shape women’s participation in the labor force?\n\n\n\n\n\nFertility_2 %&gt;% \n  gf_boxplot(ethnicity~mother_age, orientation = \"y\", color =~ havemorekids) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title=\"Ages of mothers who have 2 or more kids across ethnicities\",\n          subtitle=\"Distributed on the basis of having 2 or more children\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most ethnicities, the age distribution for mothers with more kids skews slightly higher than those without.\nOne finding is that different ethnic groups have children at different average ages:\n\nMothers in the Hispanic+Other category have children at more diverse ages, some quite young, some much older.\nIn contrast, groups like Other have narrower boxes, meaning most mothers fall within a smaller, tighter age range.\nHispanic and Hispanic + Other mothers seem to have slightly younger distributions compared to Caucasian or AFAM mothers."

    "text": "Our exploratory analysis shows that fertility and mothers’ participation in the workforce are shaped by many overlapping factors such as age, ethnicity, family structure, and cultural norms.\nMost mothers in this data set stop at two children, but those who go on to have more tend to be slightly older and often show differences in their work participation.\nEthnicity also matters: African American mothers work more weeks on average, while Hispanic and Caucasian mothers record fewer weeks, suggesting different economic pressures and support systems.\nThe gender of existing children also plays a role, with families who already have two children of the same sex more likely to have a third, reflecting a desire for balance rather than a clear gender bias.\nAre cultural expectations or financial needs the main reason why mothers stop at two children or choose to have more?\nTill what extent are their work choices voluntary, and till what extent are they shaped by inequalities in childcare, wages, and access to healthcare?\nMost importantly: What do these findings tell us about the everyday trade-offs mothers make between personal goals, cultural traditions, and the social systems around them?"

There’s a clear upward trend over time. Most recipes are highly rated, the vast majority of points cluster between 4.0-5.0 stars. There are very few points below 3.0 stars across any time period. Low ratings are rare outliers. The upward trend could mean:\n\nNewer recipes are genuinely better (improved recipe testing?)\nOnly highly-rated recipes get published/kept in recent years\nSurvivorship bias (older poorly-rated recipes may have been removed)\n\nNewer recipes (post-2020) are rated significantly higher than older ones, with the average climbing from ~3.5 to ~4.5+ stars. However, this coincides with a massive increase in recipe volume, so it’s worth investigating whether this is a quality improvement or a data collection artifact.\n\n\nnewer recipes might have fewer ratings:\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  gf_point(total_ratings ~ date_published, alpha = 0.3, color = \"maroon\" ) %&gt;% \n  gf_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"blue4\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Do Newer Recipes Have Fewer Ratings?\",\n    x = \"Date Published\",\n    y = \"Total Number of Ratings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder recipes have had more time but fewer ratings - This is counterintuitive! One would expect recipes from 2010 to have accumulated more ratings over 15 years, but they have very few. This might suggest that older recipes may be less visible/searchable on the platform or maybe even that the user base was much smaller in earlier years. Older recipes may also have been removed or not imported into current system.\nThe trend line is misleading here because it’s heavily weighted by the massive volume of recent data. The relationship isn’t really about “time to accumulate ratings”; it’s about when the platform became popular/active.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  filter(total_ratings &lt;= 50) %&gt;% \n  gf_histogram(~total_ratings, binwidth = 1, color = \"seagreen4\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Recipes with 50 or Fewer Ratings\",\n    x = \"Total Ratings\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  gf_histogram(~total_ratings, color = \"skyblue1\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \" Distribution of total Recipe Ratings\",\n    x = \"Total Ratings\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\"\n  ) \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of recipes in this dataset have 10 or fewer ratings, which means their avg_rating might not be very reliable. A recipe with 1 rating of 5 stars looks the same as a recipe with 500 ratings averaging 5 stars, but they’re very different in terms of reliability. The earlier “Do Newer Recipes Have Fewer Ratings?” plot might be misleading because it’s dominated by these low-count recipes.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  filter(total_ratings &gt;= 10) %&gt;% \n  gf_point(avg_rating ~ date_published, alpha = 0.3, color = \"maroon\") %&gt;% \n  gf_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"blue\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Recipe Ratings Over Time (≥10 ratings only)\",\n    subtitle = \"Filtered for more reliable ratings\",\n    x = \"Date Published\",\n    y = \"Average Rating\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear trend line shows a clear upward movement, rising from approximately 4.15 in 2018 to about 4.55 by 2024–2025. Building on this observation, user rating behavior may also be becoming more generous over time.\nMost ratings cluster between 4.0 and 5.0, with very few recipes rated below 4.0. One possible explanation is that users are more likely to rate recipes they enjoyed, leading to rating inflation. Another possibility is selection bias: people tend to rate only the recipes they chose to make, which were already appealing to them. The rating system may not effectively differentiate between mediocre and excellent recipes.\n\n\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(cuisines_type) , fill = \"steelblue\") %&gt;% \n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) %&gt;% \ngf_labs(\n    x = \"Cuisine Type\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\",\n    title = \"Top Cuisines by Recipe Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_cuisines &lt;- cuisines3 %&gt;%\n  count(cuisines_type) %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt;= 60) %&gt;%\n  pull(cuisines_type)\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;%\n  filter(cuisines_type %in% top_cuisines) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cuisines_type = fct_reorder(cuisines_type, avg_rating, median)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = avg_rating, y = cuisines_type)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"gold\") +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Cuisine Type\",\n    x = \"Average Rating\",\n    title = \"Rating Distribution by Cuisine Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench cuisine seems to be the most popular in this data set, followed by Cajun and Creole, both with very narrow boxes.

Recipes with long prep don’t necessarily have long cook times. Recipe timing and serving size are mostly independent variables. A recipe for 2 people could take 15 minutes or 3 hours.\n\nIn the Nutritional Content Correlations chart, we find much more interesting patterns:\ncalories ↔︎ fat: 0.867*** (VERY strong - fat drives calories)\ncalories ↔︎ protein: 0.711*** (strong - protein also adds calories)\ncalories ↔︎ carbs: 0.595*** (moderate - carbs matter less than fat/protein)\nfat ↔︎ protein: 0.573*** (moderate - dishes high in one tend to be high in the other)\navg_rating ↔︎ total_ratings: 0.087*** (weak - popular recipes aren’t necessarily better rated)\nNutrition has almost NO relationship with ratings (all correlations near zero)\n\nThrough this, we found out that calorie content is mostly predicted by fat, then protein, then carbs and that people don’t rate recipes based on nutritional content.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n   filter(cuisines_type %in% c(\"Canadian\", \"Chinese\",\"Filipino\", \"Indian\", \"Cuban\", \"Russian\")) %&gt;%  # Top 5 for clarity\n gf_boxplot(reorder(cuisines_type, total_time) ~ log10(total_time), \n             fill = ~cuisines_type, \n             orientation = \"y\", \n             alpha = 0.5) %&gt;% \n  gf_facet_wrap(vars(avg_rating)) %&gt;% \n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\")) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Log Cooking Time by Cuisine Type (Faceted by Average Rating)\",\n    x = \"Log Total Time (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Cuisine Type (ordered by time)\"\n  )\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating doesn’t necessarily correlate with cooking time: both quick and lengthy recipes can achieve high ratings. Cuisine-specific patterns persist across ratings; each cuisine maintains its characteristic cooking time profile regardless of rating. Cubans have the highest cooking time, followed by Russian cuisine. Chinese and Indian cuisines tend to cluster at lower cooking times (shorter preparation). Filipino appears relatively quick to prepare across rating levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exploratory data analysis of 2,218 recipes from Allrecipes.com revealed a diverse data set spanning 49 cuisine types, publication dates from 2009 to 2025, and a wide nutritional range. After cleaning, only 1.2% of entries were removed due to missing values.\nNutritional patterns show that calories are strongly driven by fat, followed by protein and carbs, while nutrition has almost no relationship with recipe ratings. Recipes range from minimal-calorie condiments to rich, multi-serving dishes, with averages suggesting generally balanced meals.\nOver time, average recipe ratings have steadily increased from around 3.5 in 2009 to over 4.5 by 2025, likely reflecting rating inflation or platform evolution rather than drastic quality improvements. Most recipes have few total ratings, making many averages unreliable.\nAcross cuisines, cooking time varies distinctly: Cuban and Russian dishes are the longest, while Chinese and Filipino recipes are quicker to prepare. However, rating levels remain consistent regardless of cooking duration, indicating that user satisfaction isn’t tied to effort or time spent.\nOverall, the dataset captures a rich cross-section of global cooking trends, where nutritional richness, preparation time, and popularity differ by cuisine, but ratings remain uniformly high and largely unaffected by these factors."

There’s a clear upward trend over time. Most recipes are highly rated, the vast majority of points cluster between 4.0-5.0 stars. There are very few points below 3.0 stars across any time period. Low ratings are rare outliers. The upward trend could mean:\n\nNewer recipes are genuinely better (improved recipe testing?)\nOnly highly-rated recipes get published/kept in recent years\nSurvivorship bias (older poorly-rated recipes may have been removed)\n\nNewer recipes (post-2020) are rated significantly higher than older ones, with the average climbing from ~3.5 to ~4.5+ stars. However, this coincides with a massive increase in recipe volume, so it’s worth investigating whether this is a quality improvement or a data collection artifact.\n\n\nnewer recipes might have fewer ratings:\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  gf_point(total_ratings ~ date_published, alpha = 0.3, color = \"maroon\" ) %&gt;% \n  gf_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"blue4\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Do Newer Recipes Have Fewer Ratings?\",\n    x = \"Date Published\",\n    y = \"Total Number of Ratings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder recipes have had more time but fewer ratings - This is counterintuitive! One would expect recipes from 2010 to have accumulated more ratings over 15 years, but they have very few. This might suggest that older recipes may be less visible/searchable on the platform or maybe even that the user base was much smaller in earlier years. Older recipes may also have been removed or not imported into current system.\nThe trend line is misleading here because it’s heavily weighted by the massive volume of recent data. The relationship isn’t really about “time to accumulate ratings”; it’s about when the platform became popular/active.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  filter(total_ratings &lt;= 50) %&gt;% \n  gf_histogram(~total_ratings, binwidth = 1, color = \"seagreen4\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Recipes with 50 or Fewer Ratings\",\n    x = \"Total Ratings\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  gf_histogram(~total_ratings, color = \"skyblue1\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \" Distribution of total Recipe Ratings\",\n    x = \"Total Ratings\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\"\n  ) \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of recipes in this dataset have 10 or fewer ratings, which means their avg_rating might not be very reliable. A recipe with 1 rating of 5 stars looks the same as a recipe with 500 ratings averaging 5 stars, but they’re very different in terms of reliability. The earlier “Do Newer Recipes Have Fewer Ratings?” plot might be misleading because it’s dominated by these low-count recipes.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n  filter(total_ratings &gt;= 10) %&gt;% \n  gf_point(avg_rating ~ date_published, alpha = 0.3, color = \"maroon\") %&gt;% \n  gf_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"blue\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Recipe Ratings Over Time (≥10 ratings only)\",\n    subtitle = \"Filtered for more reliable ratings\",\n    x = \"Date Published\",\n    y = \"Average Rating\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear trend line shows a clear upward movement, rising from approximately 4.15 in 2018 to about 4.55 by 2024–2025. Building on this observation, user rating behavior may also be becoming more generous over time.\nMost ratings cluster between 4.0 and 5.0, with very few recipes rated below 4.0. One possible explanation is that users are more likely to rate recipes they enjoyed, leading to rating inflation. Another possibility is selection bias: people tend to rate only the recipes they chose to make, which were already appealing to them. The rating system may not effectively differentiate between mediocre and excellent recipes.\n\n\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(cuisines_type) , fill = \"steelblue\") %&gt;% \n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) %&gt;% \ngf_labs(\n    x = \"Cuisine Type\",\n    y = \"Number of Recipes\",\n    title = \"Top Cuisines by Recipe Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_cuisines &lt;- cuisines3 %&gt;%\n  count(cuisines_type) %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt;= 60) %&gt;%\n  pull(cuisines_type)\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;%\n  filter(cuisines_type %in% top_cuisines) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cuisines_type = fct_reorder(cuisines_type, avg_rating, median)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = avg_rating, y = cuisines_type)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"gold\") +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Cuisine Type\",\n    x = \"Average Rating\",\n    title = \"Rating Distribution by Cuisine Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench cuisine seems to be the most popular in this data set, followed by Cajun and Creole, both with very narrow boxes.

Recipes with long prep don’t necessarily have long cook times. Recipe timing and serving size are mostly independent variables. A recipe for 2 people could take 15 minutes or 3 hours.\n\nIn the Nutritional Content Correlations chart, we find much more interesting patterns:\ncalories ↔︎ fat: 0.867*** (VERY strong - fat drives calories)\ncalories ↔︎ protein: 0.711*** (strong - protein also adds calories)\ncalories ↔︎ carbs: 0.595*** (moderate - carbs matter less than fat/protein)\nfat ↔︎ protein: 0.573*** (moderate - dishes high in one tend to be high in the other)\navg_rating ↔︎ total_ratings: 0.087*** (weak - popular recipes aren’t necessarily better rated)\nNutrition has almost NO relationship with ratings (all correlations near zero)\n\nThrough this, we found out that calorie content is mostly predicted by fat, then protein, then carbs and that people don’t rate recipes based on nutritional content.\n\ncuisines3 %&gt;% \n   filter(cuisines_type %in% c(\"Canadian\", \"Chinese\",\"Filipino\", \"Indian\", \"Cuban\", \"Russian\")) %&gt;%  # Top 5 for clarity\n gf_boxplot(reorder(cuisines_type, total_time) ~ log10(total_time), \n             fill = ~cuisines_type, \n             orientation = \"y\", \n             alpha = 0.5) %&gt;% \n  gf_facet_wrap(vars(avg_rating)) %&gt;% \n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\")) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Log Cooking Time by Cuisine Type (Faceted by Average Rating)\",\n    x = \"Log Total Time (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Cuisine Type (ordered by time)\"\n  )\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating doesn’t necessarily correlate with cooking time: both quick and lengthy recipes can achieve high ratings. Cuisine-specific patterns persist across ratings; each cuisine maintains its characteristic cooking time profile regardless of rating. Cubans have the highest cooking time, followed by Russian cuisine. Chinese and Indian cuisines tend to cluster at lower cooking times (shorter preparation). Filipino appears relatively quick to prepare across rating levels."

    "text": "This exploratory data analysis of 2,218 recipes from Allrecipes.com revealed a diverse data set spanning 49 cuisine types, publication dates from 2009 to 2025, and a wide nutritional range. After cleaning, only 1.2% of entries were removed due to missing values.\nNutritional patterns show that calories are strongly driven by fat, followed by protein and carbs, while nutrition has almost no relationship with recipe ratings. Recipes range from minimal-calorie condiments to rich, multi-serving dishes, with averages suggesting generally balanced meals.\nOver time, average recipe ratings have steadily increased from around 3.5 in 2009 to over 4.5 by 2025, likely reflecting rating inflation or platform evolution rather than drastic quality improvements. Most recipes have few total ratings, making many averages unreliable.\nAcross cuisines, cooking time varies distinctly: Cuban and Russian dishes are the longest, while Chinese and Filipino recipes are quicker to prepare. However, rating levels remain consistent regardless of cooking duration, indicating that user satisfaction isn’t tied to effort or time spent.\nOverall, the dataset captures a rich cross-section of global cooking trends, where nutritional richness, preparation time, and popularity differ by cuisine, but ratings remain uniformly high and largely unaffected by these factors."

    "text": "A2 part 4 Migration Map (1000 Cranes Kazhakhstan)\nFor this assignment, we explored the dataset “1000 Cranes – Southern Kazakhstan,” which records the movements of the Demoiselle Crane (Anthropoides virgo). The dataset provides a detailed look into one of the world’s most fascinating migration systems: a journey that connects breeding grounds in Central Asia to wintering areas in the Indian subcontinent. By mapping their routes and observing their stopovers, we aimed to understand how these cranes navigate diverse landscapes and international borders in response to seasonal changes.\nDemoiselle cranes often breed in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China and Turkey, migrating through Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Tibet (China), Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Egypt and winter in India, Pakistan, Sudan, Chad, or other Sahel/Northeast Africa.\nThe breeding grounds of the cranes mapped in this dataset are KazhakhstanandChina. Migration/Stop over countries include Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Wintering Grounds include Pakistan and India- notably Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\nSetting up the libraries:\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rnaturalearthdata'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:rnaturalearth':\n\n    countries110\n\n# Run this in your console first\n# devtools::install_github(\"ropensci/rnaturalearthhires\")\nlibrary(rnaturalearthhires)\n\n# Plotting Maps\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Maps using ggplot() + geom_sf()\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(ggformula) # Maps using gf_sf()\n\nLoading required package: scales\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\nLoading required package: ggridges\n\nNew to ggformula?

The p.value is shown to be 0.002, which is lesser than 0.05; This is statistically significant! Confidence Intervals range from 58.8% and 87.3%, and does not include 50% in them. We can confidently conclude that a majority of students find tattoos attractive.\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows that gender doesn’t really make a difference in how Srishti students view tattoos: both male and female students seem to find them equally attractive.\nAbout 75% of students without tattoos said they find tattoos attractive, and the binomial test confirms this is statistically significant (p = 0.002). Since the confidence interval (58.8%–87.3%) doesn’t include 50%, we can confidently say that most students think tattoos make a person more attractive.\nOverall, the results suggest that tattoos are seen positively at Srishti, and the perception isn’t influenced much by gender."

This suggests that gender does not play a major role in perceptions of tattoo attractiveness: both male and female students tend to view tattoos positively to a similar extent.\n\nTattootable &lt;- vcd::structable(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data= Tattoo1)\nTattootable\n\n                  gender  F  M\ntattoo_attractive             \nYes                      15 15\nNo                        5  5\n\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = Tattoo1, \n            direction = \"v\", gp = shading_max, legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = Tattoo1, \n            type = \"expected\", direction = \"v\", gp = shading_max, \n            legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::assoc(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, \n           data = Tattoo1, \n           gp = shading_max, \n           legend = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this mosaic chart doesn’t say much, it is pretty interesting to see how there is no deviation across the observed chart or the assoc chart. Let us look at some other graphs instead.\n\nTattoo1 %&gt;%\n  gf_props(~tattoo_attractive,\n    fill = ~gender,\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    x = \"Do they find Tattoos Attractive?\",\n    title = \"Proportion of Tattoo Attractiveness Responses Across Genders\",\n        subtitle = \"Filled bar graph\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis further validates our hypothesis above.\n\n\n\n\n\nTattoo1 %&gt;%\n  summarize(prop = prop(tattoo_attractive, success = \"Yes\"), n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   prop     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1  0.75    40\n\n\nOut of 40 responses, 75% of the sample set found Tattoos attractive.

The p.value is shown to be 0.002, which is lesser than 0.05; This is statistically significant! Confidence Intervals range from 58.8% and 87.3%, and does not include 50% in them. We can confidently conclude that a majority of students find tattoos attractive.\n\n\n\n\nThe data shows that gender doesn’t really make a difference in how Srishti students view tattoos: both male and female students seem to find them equally attractive.\nAbout 75% of students without tattoos said they find tattoos attractive, and the binomial test confirms this is statistically significant (p = 0.002). Since the confidence interval (58.8%–87.3%) doesn’t include 50%, we can confidently say that most students think tattoos make a person more attractive.\nOverall, the results suggest that tattoos are seen positively at Srishti, and the perception isn’t influenced much by gender."

A long tail extends to the right, with some students having very high absences (up to ~80 days). This suggests most students have good attendance, but a small group has chronic absenteeism. One hypothese is that the histogram bins suggests different patterns of absenteeism (e.g., occasional illness vs. chronic issues or even other causes).\nQuestions this raises: Who are the extreme cases? Are the students with 60-80 days absent concentrated in specific demographic groups (ethnicity, learning pace, grade_group, sex)?\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_violin(ethnicity ~ days_absent, fill = ~sex) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Absenteeism Across Ethnicities and Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Violin plot, we see that the distribution for Aboriginal females show dramatically more variability than Non-Aboriginal females. For the males, we see more similar patterns across ethnicities, though Aboriginal males have slightly wider spread. Aboriginal students show much greater variability (wider violins). Non-Aboriginal students have more concentrated, predictable attendance patterns.\nWhat drives the huge variability in Aboriginal female attendance? Some attend very well, others miss extensively.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \n  gf_histogram(~days_absent) %&gt;% \n  gf_facet_wrap(~ethnicity) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Days Absent by Ethnicity\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing absenteeism patterns between Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal students\",\n    x = \"Days Absent\",\n    y = \"Counts\"\n  )\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

The shape difference suggests differing attendance dynamics between ethnic groups.\nWhy do Non-Aboriginal students show more homogeneous patterns? More stable circumstances? Better support systems?\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \ndplyr::count(ethnicity, sex, grade_group, learning_pace)\n\n# A tibble: 28 × 5\n   ethnicity sex   grade_group learning_pace     n\n   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1 A         F     F0          AL                4\n 2 A         F     F0          SL                1\n 3 A         F     F1          AL                5\n 4 A         F     F1          SL               10\n 5 A         F     F2          AL                1\n 6 A         F     F2          SL                8\n 7 A         F     F3          AL                9\n 8 A         M     F0          AL                5\n 9 A         M     F0          SL                3\n10 A         M     F1          AL                2\n# ℹ 18 more rows\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \ndplyr::count(grade_group)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  grade_group     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 F0             27\n2 F1             46\n3 F2             40\n4 F3             33\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \ndplyr::count(learning_pace)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  learning_pace     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 AL               83\n2 SL               63\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \ndplyr::count(grade_group, learning_pace)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 3\n  grade_group learning_pace     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 F0          AL               19\n2 F0          SL                8\n3 F1          AL               15\n4 F1          SL               31\n5 F2          AL               16\n6 F2          SL               24\n7 F3          AL               33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF3 (33 entries) comprises of only Average Learner Students.\nWe could see how many average and slow learners exist in each ethnicity.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \n\n  gf_bar(~ethnicity,\n    fill = ~learning_pace,\n    position = \"dodge\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Average and Slow Learners Across Ethnicities\") %&gt;% \n  gf_facet_wrap(~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \ndplyr::count(ethnicity, sex, learning_pace)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  ethnicity sex   learning_pace     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 A         F     AL               19\n2 A         F     SL               19\n3 A         M     AL               21\n4 A         M     SL               10\n5 N         F     AL               21\n6 N         F     SL               21\n7 N         M     AL               22\n8 N         M     SL               13\n\n\nLearning pace classifications are quite evenly distributed for females regardless of ethnicity.\nMales have proportionally fewer slow learners than females.

Gender has minimal impact on absenteeism patterns within either ethnic group. The majority of students across all groups are absent 0-22 days, with the mean and standard error clearly displayed for easy comparison.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_boxplot(grade_group ~ days_absent,\n             fill = ~sex,\n             orientation = \"y\",\n             alpha = 0.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(learning_pace ~ ethnicity) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set1\")) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Absenteeism by Grade, Learning Pace, Sex, and Ethnicity\",\n    x = \"Days Absent\",\n    y = \"Grade Group\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage learners had generally lower absences across all groups. The median is also typically under 20 days for most groups. Slow learners, on the other hand, had dramatically higher absences, especially for Aboriginal females in F2 (median ~30-40 days, extends to 80+ days) and Non-Aboriginal males in F0 (huge spread, median ~18 days, extends to 60+ days). This difference appears across almost every category, suggesting a strong link between learning pace and attendance.\nWith regards to ethnicity patterns, Aboriginal students showed greater variation, especially among slow learners. F2 Female slow learners had exceptionally high absences while Aboriginal male average learners (F2) also showed notable absences. For Non-Aboriginal Average Learning Students, the distribution was more concentrated. Non-Aboriginal male Slow Learners in F0 show unusually high absences (40+ days median). What is also interesting here is how in F3, Non-Aboriginal Average Learning male Students had a median absence range of 20+ and extending to 60+. Can’t be compared to SL as there is no data for the same.\nAcross grade levels, absences tend to rise slightly as students move up, but slow learners remain irregular regardless of grade. Gender differences are smaller but visible in certain cases, such as SL Aboriginal females in F2 and SL Non-Aboriginal males in F0, both of whom show higher absences than their counterparts.\nIn short, slow learners (especially Aboriginal females in F2) are the most vulnerable group, while average learners in lower grades show the best attendance. Thus, we can say that Students classified as Slow Learners miss significantly more school.\nThis raises an important question: Are they slow learners because they miss school, or or do they fall behind because of frequent absences?\n\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_density_ridges(grade_group ~ days_absent, \n                    fill = ~grade_group, \n                    alpha = 0.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(\n    name = \"Grade Group\",\n    palette = \"Spectral\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Days Absent by Grade Level\",\n    subtitle = \"Ridge Plot showing absenteeism patterns across grades\",\n    x = \"Days Absent\",\n    y = \"Grade Group\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 5.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsenteeism patterns vary significantly by grade level, with younger students (F0) showing more consistent attendance and older students (F1-F3) displaying greater variability.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_violin( grade_group ~ days_absent, \n            fill = ~grade_group, \n            colour = ~grade_group, \n            alpha = 0.5,\n            draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(sex ~ ethnicity,\n                labeller = labeller(\n                  sex = c(F = \"Female\", M = \"Male\"),\n                  ethnicity = c(A = \"Aboriginal\", N = \"Non-Aboriginal\")\n                )) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Days Absent by Grade Group\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Sex and Ethnicity with quartile lines\",\n    x = \"Grade Group\",\n    y = \"Days Absent\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_theme(theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)))\n\nWarning: The `draw_quantiles` argument of `stat_ydensity()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n4.0.0.\nℹ Please use the `quantiles` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(ethnicity, sex)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  ethnicity sex       n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 A         F        38\n2 A         M        31\n3 N         F        42\n4 N         M        35\n\n\n\nabsent_table &lt;- xtabs(~ ethnicity + sex + learning_pace + grade_group, data = absenteeism1)\n\n# now make the mosaic plot\nvcd::mosaic(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Observed Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n              type = \"expected\",\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: expected Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::assoc(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Associated Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the mosaic observed chart, it is evident that there is more sampling in the F1 grade group compared to other grades. There are also significantly more slow learners in F1 than expected, especially among females across both ethnicities. In contrast, there are fewer than expected average learners in the female F2 group across both ethnicities.\nThe expected frequencies plot illustrates how students would be distributed if grade, ethnicity, sex, and learning pace were completely independent of one another. The p-values comparing observed and expected frequencies confirm that these variables are associated. Specifically, F1 Aboriginal slow learners are over-represented, while F2 Aboriginal female average learners and F3 Non-Aboriginal female slow learners are underrepresented compared to what random chance would predict.\nThe association plot also reveals the above learning.\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis shows that student absenteeism isn’t random, it’s shaped by a mix of factors, with learning pace standing out as the strongest one. Across almost every group, slow learners miss more school days than average learners, raising an important question: do they fall behind because they miss school, or do they miss school because they’re already struggling?\nThere are also clear ethnic differences. Aboriginal students tend to have higher average absences and more variation in attendance, especially among females, while Non-Aboriginal students show steadier attendance patterns with only a few extreme cases. Gender by itself doesn’t make a huge difference overall, but certain groups stand out: like Aboriginal female slow learners in F2 and Non-Aboriginal male slow learners in F0, both showing patterns of chronic absenteeism.\nAbsences also seem to rise slightly with grade level, hinting that older students face more challenges staying consistent. The mosaic plot backs this up, showing significant associations between grade, ethnicity, sex, and learning pace, with F1 showing an unexpected spike in slow learners.\nOverall, the findings point to a cycle where learning difficulty and absenteeism reinforce each other. Breaking that loop, especially for vulnerable groups like Aboriginal slow learners, will likely require focused, context-specific support rather than one-size-fits-all educational policies."

A long tail extends to the right, with some students having very high absences (up to ~80 days). This suggests most students have good attendance, but a small group has chronic absenteeism. One hypothese is that the histogram bins suggests different patterns of absenteeism (e.g., occasional illness vs. chronic issues or even other causes).\nQuestions this raises: Who are the extreme cases? Are the students with 60-80 days absent concentrated in specific demographic groups (ethnicity, learning pace, grade_group, sex)?\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_violin(ethnicity ~ days_absent, fill = ~sex) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Absenteeism Across Ethnicities and Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Violin plot, we see that the distribution for Aboriginal females show dramatically more variability than Non-Aboriginal females.

Both ethnic groups show similar patterns (more AL than SL), but Aboriginal males have a slightly larger gap.\nWhy are more males classified as Average Learners compared to females? Is this a real educational difference, or could there be bias in how learning pace is assessed?\n\nNext, we checked whether students from different ethnicities showed different absenteeism patterns:\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;% \n  gf_boxplot(ethnicity~days_absent, orientation = \"y\", color =~ learning_pace) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title=\"Absenteeism Patterns Across Ethnicity and Learning Pace\",\n          subtitle=\"Faceted by sex to examine gender differences\") %&gt;% \n    gf_facet_wrap(~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a better idea on the impact of ethnicity and sex on days of absence:\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_jitter(ethnicity ~ days_absent, \n            color = ~sex,\n            width = 0, \n            height = 0.2,\n            alpha = 0.9) %&gt;%\n  gf_summary(fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n             geom = \"pointrange\", \n             size = 0.8, \n             color = \"black\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title=\"Student Absenteeism by Ethnicity and Gender (Mean ± SE)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal students have slightly higher average absenteeism (~20 days) compared to non-Aboriginal students (~15 days), though non-Aboriginal students show greater variability with more extreme outliers (40-80+ days absent). Gender has minimal impact on absenteeism patterns within either ethnic group. The majority of students across all groups are absent 0-22 days, with the mean and standard error clearly displayed for easy comparison.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_boxplot(grade_group ~ days_absent,\n             fill = ~sex,\n             orientation = \"y\",\n             alpha = 0.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(learning_pace ~ ethnicity) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set1\")) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Absenteeism by Grade, Learning Pace, Sex, and Ethnicity\",\n    x = \"Days Absent\",\n    y = \"Grade Group\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage learners had generally lower absences across all groups. The median is also typically under 20 days for most groups. Slow learners, on the other hand, had dramatically higher absences, especially for Aboriginal females in F2 (median ~30-40 days, extends to 80+ days) and Non-Aboriginal males in F0 (huge spread, median ~18 days, extends to 60+ days). This difference appears across almost every category, suggesting a strong link between learning pace and attendance.\nWith regards to ethnicity patterns, Aboriginal students showed greater variation, especially among slow learners. F2 Female slow learners had exceptionally high absences while Aboriginal male average learners (F2) also showed notable absences. For Non-Aboriginal Average Learning Students, the distribution was more concentrated. Non-Aboriginal male Slow Learners in F0 show unusually high absences (40+ days median). What is also interesting here is how in F3, Non-Aboriginal Average Learning male Students had a median absence range of 20+ and extending to 60+. Can’t be compared to SL as there is no data for the same.\nAcross grade levels, absences tend to rise slightly as students move up, but slow learners remain irregular regardless of grade. Gender differences are smaller but visible in certain cases, such as SL Aboriginal females in F2 and SL Non-Aboriginal males in F0, both of whom show higher absences than their counterparts.\nIn short, slow learners (especially Aboriginal females in F2) are the most vulnerable group, while average learners in lower grades show the best attendance. Thus, we can say that Students classified as Slow Learners miss significantly more school.\nThis raises an important question: Are they slow learners because they miss school, or or do they fall behind because of frequent absences?\n\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_density_ridges(grade_group ~ days_absent, \n                    fill = ~grade_group, \n                    alpha = 0.5) %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(\n    name = \"Grade Group\",\n    palette = \"Spectral\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Days Absent by Grade Level\",\n    subtitle = \"Ridge Plot showing absenteeism patterns across grades\",\n    x = \"Days Absent\",\n    y = \"Grade Group\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 5.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsenteeism patterns vary significantly by grade level, with younger students (F0) showing more consistent attendance and older students (F1-F3) displaying greater variability.\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  gf_violin( grade_group ~ days_absent, \n            fill = ~grade_group, \n            colour = ~grade_group, \n            alpha = 0.5,\n            draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)) %&gt;%\n  gf_facet_grid(sex ~ ethnicity,\n                labeller = labeller(\n                  sex = c(F = \"Female\", M = \"Male\"),\n                  ethnicity = c(A = \"Aboriginal\", N = \"Non-Aboriginal\")\n                )) %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Days Absent by Grade Group\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Sex and Ethnicity with quartile lines\",\n    x = \"Grade Group\",\n    y = \"Days Absent\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_theme(theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)))\n\nWarning: The `draw_quantiles` argument of `stat_ydensity()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n4.0.0.\nℹ Please use the `quantiles` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsenteeism1 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(ethnicity, sex)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  ethnicity sex       n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 A         F        38\n2 A         M        31\n3 N         F        42\n4 N         M        35\n\n\n\nabsent_table &lt;- xtabs(~ ethnicity + sex + learning_pace + grade_group, data = absenteeism1)\n\n# now make the mosaic plot\nvcd::mosaic(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Observed Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n              type = \"expected\",\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: expected Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcd::assoc(absent_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Associated Frequencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the mosaic observed chart, it is evident that there is more sampling in the F1 grade group compared to other grades. There are also significantly more slow learners in F1 than expected, especially among females across both ethnicities. In contrast, there are fewer than expected average learners in the female F2 group across both ethnicities.\nThe expected frequencies plot illustrates how students would be distributed if grade, ethnicity, sex, and learning pace were completely independent of one another. The p-values comparing observed and expected frequencies confirm that these variables are associated. Specifically, F1 Aboriginal slow learners are over-represented, while F2 Aboriginal female average learners and F3 Non-Aboriginal female slow learners are underrepresented compared to what random chance would predict.\nThe association plot also reveals the above learning."

    "text": "This analysis shows that student absenteeism isn’t random, it’s shaped by a mix of factors, with learning pace standing out as the strongest one. Across almost every group, slow learners miss more school days than average learners, raising an important question: do they fall behind because they miss school, or do they miss school because they’re already struggling?\nThere are also clear ethnic differences. Aboriginal students tend to have higher average absences and more variation in attendance, especially among females, while Non-Aboriginal students show steadier attendance patterns with only a few extreme cases. Gender by itself doesn’t make a huge difference overall, but certain groups stand out: like Aboriginal female slow learners in F2 and Non-Aboriginal male slow learners in F0, both showing patterns of chronic absenteeism.\nAbsences also seem to rise slightly with grade level, hinting that older students face more challenges staying consistent. The mosaic plot backs this up, showing significant associations between grade, ethnicity, sex, and learning pace, with F1 showing an unexpected spike in slow learners.\nOverall, the findings point to a cycle where learning difficulty and absenteeism reinforce each other. Breaking that loop, especially for vulnerable groups like Aboriginal slow learners, will likely require focused, context-specific support rather than one-size-fits-all educational policies."

along borders. This led us to two possible speculations:\n\nMany of these sightings could actually be advanced military aircraft, which people may misinterpret as UFOs.\nThe combination of heat and light reflections in these regions may create mirage-like formations, leading to unusual visual experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look into UFO sightings for different states, cities, months, years and

to notice UFOs.\nFlorida: Regular rocket launches (NASA, SpaceX) can look strange to the untrained eye. Florida’s flat terrain, huge population, outdoor lifestyle can lead to these sightings.\nWashington: Birthplace of the “flying saucer” craze (Kenneth Arnold, 1947). Mix of mountains, open skies, and military activity.\nTexas: Huge skies, massive military presence, and a strong UFO subculture (the Stephenville Lights of 2008 are a famous case)\nNew York: NYC is too bright for stargazing, but upstate NY has dark skies. Huge population also amounts to a lot of reporting.\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(location_state) , fill = \"navy\") %&gt;% \n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) %&gt;%

reported seeing “flying saucers” near Mt. Rainier in 1947, sparking the term. Lots of open sky, military air traffic, and aerospace presence (Boeing) keep it a hotbed for sightings.\nPhoenix\nThe Phoenix Lights (1997) is one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in history: thousands of people saw unexplained lights. Clear skies and Air Force activity in the desert make it easy to see anomalies.\nLas Vegas\nA hub for UFO activity and alien-themed tourism. The area is home to attractions like the Extraterrestrial Highway and offers tours that visit UFO hotspots and the infamous Area 51 perimeter.\nPortland\nMcMenamins UFO Festival, an annual event celebrating extraterrestrial interests is held in McMinnville, a town about an hour southwest of Portland.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation: They’re the most populous states more people means more eyes.\nAerospace & military bases: California (Edwards, China Lake), Florida (Cape Canaveral, Eglin AFB), Texas (Dyess, Lackland), Ohio (Wright‑Patt), Arizona (Luke AFB), etc. Many UFOs end up being secret/test aircraft.\nClear skies & open land: Deserts, plains, and rural areas make lights and objects obvious.\nCultural priming: Hollywood, sci‑fi, and social media amplify reports.\nOutdoor lifestyles: Warm states = people outside more at night, seeing the sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(dates_sighted_month) %&gt;%\n   arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n  tt()\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n

1998\n\n\n\n\n\n1947: The Arnold Sighting - Widely regarded as the first well-documented UFO sighting in the United States.\n1961: The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction Case - One of the first widely publicized alien abduction stories in the U.S., fueling public imagination.\n1977: Star Wars, A New Hope - Popularized space culture and heightened public fascination with extraterrestrials.\n1990: The Kodak Brownie - Affordable and accessible cameras became common, making it easier to document unusual sightings.\n1991: Launch of the World Wide Web - Broader access to share and spread UFO stories globally.\n1997: Phoenix Lights Incident: One of the most famous mass UFO sightings in the U.S., heavily reported.\n2007: iPhone launch - Smartphones put cameras and internet access in everyone’s pocket.\n2011: Apollo 18 Film - Reinforced pop culture connections between space exploration and alien speculation.\n\nMost UFO sightings were reported after the 2000s, highlighting a clear disparity compared to earlier decades. This raises several possibilities:\n\nWere people in earlier years less aware, or less inclined to report such phenomena?\nDid the availability of consumer technology (affordable cameras, smartphones, the internet) lead to more documentation?\nCould cultural influences, such as the popularity of Star Wars and other science fiction, have fueled public imagination and reporting?\n\nNote: Despite the dataset’s size, years with fewer reported sightings may not yield reliable insights, lower counts could reflect under-documentation rather than a true decline in sightings.\n\n\n\n\nufo_avg_month

a difference in the average months of sightings.\nThere is a sudden drop for the year 2014, which may be due to incomplete data for the entire year as mentioned above\n\n\n\n\n\nWe infer that, more

common shapes are triangle, circle, fireball, disk, sphere, oval. This shows people often associate UFOs with simple, symmetrical forms or perhaps influenced by pop culture depictions of flying saucers and triangles.\nCategories like unknown and other also appear relatively high, which means that there’s lack of description leading to poor confidence of it being a UFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;%\n  filter(data_encounter_duration &lt; 100000) %&gt;% # Removing extreme outliers\n  gf_boxplot(data_encounter_duration ~ data_shape, \n             fill = \"violet\", orientation = \"x\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    x = \"UFO Shape\",\n    y = \"Encounter Duration\",\n    title = \"Encounter Durations by Shape\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting the time into Log due to the extreme variation in the encountered duration.\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;%\n  filter(data_encounter_duration &lt; 100000) %&gt;%   # Removing extreme outliers\n  mutate(data_shape = fct_infreq(data_shape)) %&gt;% # Reordering shapes in desc. order of their sightings\n  gf_boxplot(data_encounter_duration ~ data_shape, \n             fill = \"violet\", orientation = \"x\") %&gt;%\n  gf_refine(scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_number())) %&gt;% #Making the timeline in log, then labelling it in numbers\n  gf_labs(\n    x = \"UFO Shape\",\n    y = \"Encounter Duration (log sec)\",\n    title = \"Encounter Durations by Shape\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost UFO shapes (light, triangle, circle, fireball, sphere, disk, etc.) have their median encounter duration between 30 seconds and a few minutes.\nAlmost every shape shows extreme outliers (encounters lasting hours or more).\nFlash is perceived instantly hence might have lowest median\nChange has the highest median which may be due to longer encounter duration needed to see its change\nSome shapes like circle, disk, oval, and triangle have a wider spread, suggesting they’re more often reported in longer encounters.\n\n\n\n\nThe data suggests that common, simpler shapes (light, circle, triangle) are usually seen briefly, while rarer, structured shapes (cylinder, diamond, chevron) tend to be reported for longer durations.

The data consistently shows that:\n\nReporting patterns correlate strongly with human behavior - sightings peak during summer months, evening hours, and in populated areas with outdoor lifestyles\nTechnological accessibility drives documentation - the dramatic increase in reports post-2000 aligns with the proliferation of cameras, smartphones, and internet access\nPerception outweighs substance - the overwhelming prevalence of “light” sightings across all regions suggests most reports involve misidentified conventional phenomena rather than structured objects\nCultural and psychological factors heavily influence reporting, with consistency in shapes and patterns revealing more about human perception than about the phenomena themselves\n\nThe evidence suggests that while some sightings remain unexplained, the majority likely represent natural phenomena, human-made objects, or psychological misconceptions amplified by cultural context and technological accessibility."

along borders. This led us to two possible speculations:\n\nMany of these sightings could actually be advanced military aircraft, which people may misinterpret as UFOs.\nThe combination of heat and light reflections in these regions may create mirage-like formations, leading to unusual visual experiences."

Florida’s flat terrain, huge population, outdoor lifestyle can lead to these sightings.\nWashington: Birthplace of the “flying saucer” craze (Kenneth Arnold, 1947). Mix of mountains, open skies, and military activity.\nTexas: Huge skies, massive military presence, and a strong UFO subculture (the Stephenville Lights of 2008 are a famous case)\nNew York: NYC is too bright for stargazing, but upstate NY has dark skies. Huge population also amounts to a lot of reporting.\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;% \n  gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(location_state) , fill = \"navy\") %&gt;% \n  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) %&gt;%

reported seeing “flying saucers” near Mt. Rainier in 1947, sparking the term. Lots of open sky, military air traffic, and aerospace presence (Boeing) keep it a hotbed for sightings.\nPhoenix\nThe Phoenix Lights (1997) is one of the most famous mass UFO sightings in history: thousands of people saw unexplained lights. Clear skies and Air Force activity in the desert make it easy to see anomalies.\nLas Vegas\nA hub for UFO activity and alien-themed tourism. The area is home to attractions like the Extraterrestrial Highway and offers tours that visit UFO hotspots and the infamous Area 51 perimeter.\nPortland\nMcMenamins UFO Festival, an annual event celebrating extraterrestrial interests is held in McMinnville, a town about an hour southwest of Portland.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation: They’re the most populous states more people means more eyes.\nAerospace & military bases: California (Edwards, China Lake), Florida (Cape Canaveral, Eglin AFB), Texas (Dyess, Lackland), Ohio (Wright‑Patt), Arizona (Luke AFB), etc. Many UFOs end up being secret/test aircraft.\nClear skies & open land: Deserts, plains, and rural areas make lights and objects obvious.\nCultural priming: Hollywood, sci‑fi, and social media amplify reports.\nOutdoor lifestyles: Warm states = people outside more at night, seeing the sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nufo_mod2 %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(dates_sighted_month) %&gt;%\n   arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n  tt()\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n

2013\nDecrease in no. of sightings for the year 2014, might be due to incomplete documentation for the entire year\nThe first 100 sightings begin from 1965\nThe first 1000 sightings begin from 1998\n\n\n\n\n\n1947: The Arnold Sighting - Widely regarded as the first well-documented UFO sighting in the United States.\n1961: The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction Case - One of the first widely publicized alien abduction stories in the U.S., fueling public imagination.\n1977: Star Wars, A New Hope - Popularized space culture and heightened public fascination with extraterrestrials.\n1990: The Kodak Brownie - Affordable and accessible cameras became common, making it easier to document unusual sightings.\n1991: Launch of the World Wide Web - Broader access to share and spread UFO stories globally.\n1997: Phoenix Lights Incident: One of the most famous mass UFO sightings in the U.S., heavily reported.\n2007: iPhone launch - Smartphones put cameras and internet access in everyone’s pocket.\n2011: Apollo 18 Film - Reinforced pop culture connections between space exploration and alien speculation.\n\nMost UFO sightings were reported after the 2000s, highlighting a clear disparity compared to earlier decades. This raises several possibilities:\n\nWere people in earlier years less aware, or less inclined to report such phenomena?\nDid the availability of consumer technology (affordable cameras, smartphones, the internet) lead to more documentation?\nCould cultural influences, such as the popularity of Star Wars and other science fiction, have fueled public imagination and reporting?\n\nNote: Despite the dataset’s size, years with fewer reported sightings may not yield reliable insights, lower counts could reflect under-documentation rather than a true decline in sightings.\n\n\n\n\nufo_avg_month

a difference in the average months of sightings.\nThere is a sudden drop for the year 2014, which may be due to incomplete data for the entire year as mentioned above\n\n\n\n\n\nWe infer that, more sightings have been during summers (mostly during July), which may be caused my summer holidays, more outings and hence more observations by the people.\n\nLet’s check how shapes are related with

    "text": "The analysis reveals that UFO sightings are predominantly human-driven phenomena influenced by technological, psychological, and environmental factors rather than evidence of extraterrestrial activity. The data consistently shows that:\n\nReporting patterns correlate strongly with human behavior - sightings peak during summer months, evening hours, and in populated areas with outdoor lifestyles\nTechnological accessibility drives documentation - the dramatic increase in reports post-2000 aligns with the proliferation of cameras, smartphones, and internet access\nPerception outweighs substance - the overwhelming prevalence of “light” sightings across all regions suggests most reports involve misidentified conventional phenomena rather than structured objects\nCultural and psychological factors heavily influence reporting, with consistency in shapes and patterns revealing more about human perception than about the phenomena themselves\n\nThe evidence suggests that while some sightings remain unexplained, the majority likely represent natural phenomena, human-made objects, or psychological misconceptions amplified by cultural context and technological accessibility."

The number of successes, which is the statistic, show that 26 people said “yes” to believing in God. Our confidence intervals for this data lies in between 46.9% and 77.8%. The p-value here however, is 0.11, which is higher than 0.05. So this is NOT statistically significant.\n\n\n\nEven though more students believe than don’t, this difference could be due to chance. Hence, we cannot conclude that belief is more prevalent than non-belief in Srishti."

The number of successes, which is the statistic, show that 26 people said “yes” to believing in God. Our confidence intervals for this data lies in between 46.9% and 77.8%. The p-value here however, is 0.11, which is higher than 0.05. So this is NOT statistically significant.\n\n\n\nEven though more students believe than don’t, this difference could be due to chance. Hence, we cannot conclude that belief is more prevalent than non-belief in Srishti."

The median will be much lower than the mean for both groups. Females seem to portray comparatively consistent and moderate spending behavior, in contrast to males, showing more diverse spending behaviors.\n\nWeeklyexp1 %&gt;% \ngf_boxplot(gender~total_expenditure_last_week, orientation = \"y\") %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title=\"Distribution of expenditure by Srishti Students\",\n          subtitle=\"During the week of Diwali\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this boxplot, we understand that males on average spent more during diwali than females in srishti.\n\nWeeklyexp1 %&gt;% \ngf_violin(gender  ~ total_expenditure_last_week, fill = ~gender) %&gt;% \n  gf_labs(title=\"Distribution of expenditure by Srishti Students\",\n          subtitle=\"During the week of Diwali\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor female students, we see the highest density at approximately ₹1,000-₹2,000. We also see very few students beyond ₹5,000.\nFor male students,primary density peak at ₹2,000-₹4,000. But the distribution is flatter, meaning that the density is more spread out. Multiple smaller peaks suggest different spending subgroups:\n\nBudget spenders (₹0-₹5K) - majority\nModerate spenders (₹10-15K) - small group\nHigh spenders (₹20-25K) - few individuals\nExtreme spenders (₹50K+) - rare cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeeklyexp1%&gt;% \n  gf_density(~total_expenditure_last_week) %&gt;%\n  gf_fitdistr(dist = \"dnorm\") %&gt;%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Density of Total expenditure\",\n    subtitle = \"Compared with Normal Density\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is far from the normality curve. This is a severe violation of the normality assumptions. Most students spend very little, but the few high spenders are SO extreme that they pull the theoretical normal distribution way to the right, making it completely misaligned with reality.\n\nstats::shapiro.test(x = Weeklyexp1$total_expenditure_last_week) %&gt;%\n  broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  statistic  p.value method                     \n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      \n1     0.480 9.90e-11 Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\n\nSince the p.value is EXTREMELY small, we should reject the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution.\nWe ideally should not be running a t-test because of the above reasons:\n\nt4 &lt;- mosaic::t_test(\n  Weeklyexp1$total_expenditure_last_week, # Name of variable\n  mu = 2000, # belief\n  alternative = \"two.sided\"\n) %&gt;% # Check both sides\n  broom::tidy()\nt4\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  estimate statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method     alternative\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      \n1    4833.      2.10  0.0420        39    2108.     7558.

Males generally spent more than females, but the variation within the male group is much higher. The distribution clearly violates normality assumptions, as confirmed by the Shapiro–Wilk test."

We also see very few students beyond ₹5,000.\nFor male students,primary density peak at ₹2,000-₹4,000. But the distribution is flatter, meaning that the density is more spread out. Multiple smaller peaks suggest different spending subgroups:\n\nBudget spenders (₹0-₹5K) - majority\nModerate spenders (₹10-15K) - small group\nHigh spenders (₹20-25K) - few individuals\nExtreme spenders (₹50K+) - rare cases"

CVD prevalence appears relatively low in this sample, while smoking status shows diverse patterns across the population.\n\nNext, we checked patterns across social class and smoking:\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(y = smoking_status, x = age_years, fill = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot of Smoking Status by Age and Sex\",\n    subtitle = \"Examining smoking categories by age distributions and gender\",\n    y = \"Smoking Status\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The boxplot reveals distinct age patterns across smoking status categories. Former smokers tend to be older on average, while current smokers show a wider age distribution. The patterns are largely consistent between males and females, suggesting similar smoking behavior trajectories across genders. Never-smokers show a broad age range, indicating that non-smoking is prevalent across all adult age groups.\n\n\nscottish1 &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(smoking_status = as.factor(smoking_status))\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(x = age_years, y = smoking_status, fill = smoking_status)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Age by Smoking Status\",\n    subtitle = \"Ridge Plot showing age patterns across smoking categories\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    y = \"Smoking Status\",\n    fill = \"Smoking Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 3.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The ridgeline plot provides a clear visualization of how age distributions vary across different smoking status categories. Each smoking category shows its own distinct age profile, with overlapping curves indicating areas where multiple smoking behaviors are common at similar ages. Some categories show bimodal distributions, suggesting different age-related patterns of smoking initiation, continuation, or cessation within the Scottish population.\n\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(x = social_class, y = age_years, fill = respondent_sex, color = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7, draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Violin Plot of Age by Social Class and Sex\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution shapes with quartile lines\",\n    x = \"Social Class\",\n    y = \"Age (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\",\n    color = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\nWarning: The `draw_quantiles` argument of `geom_violin()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n4.0.0.\nℹ Please use the `quantiles.linetype` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Age distributions across social class categories show minimal variation, with all three social classes having similar median ages and spreads. This indicates that social class in this sample is not strongly age-dependent, and the survey captured individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds across the full adult age range. Both males and females show comparable patterns within each social class.\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(x = age_years, y = deprivation_score)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1.5, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE, size = 1.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age vs Deprivation Score with Trend Line\",\n    subtitle = \"Exploring the relationship between age and socioeconomic deprivation\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    y = \"Carstairs Deprivation Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The scatterplot with a smoothed trend line (LOESS) reveals no strong linear relationship between age and deprivation score. The relatively flat trend line with a wide confidence band confirms that deprivation affects all age groups equally in this Scottish population. Individuals of all ages are found across the full range of deprivation scores, indicating that socioeconomic disadvantage is not concentrated in any particular age group.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Find top 10 area codes by respondent count\ntop_areas &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;%\n  count(area) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, n) %&gt;%\n  pull(area)\n\n# Filter data to only those top 10 areas\nscottish_top_areas &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;% filter(area %in% top_areas)\n\n# Scatter plot of deprivation score by area code (for top 10 areas)\nggplot(scottish_top_areas, aes(x = as.factor(area), y = deprivation_score)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \"steelblue\", size = 1.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Deprivation Score: Top 10 Areas (Scatterplot)\",\n    subtitle = \"Individual deprivation scores in the most sampled area codes\",\n    x = \"Area Code\",\n    y = \"Carstairs Deprivation Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Focusing on the top 10 geographic areas or grouping areas by decile reveals substantial variation in deprivation scores across regions. Some codes or groups show consistently higher median deprivation, indicating more disadvantaged populations; others indicate lower median deprivation and greater affluence. Socioeconomic heterogeneity is visible within most regions, reflecting the mix of affluent and deprived communities present even in the same geographic area. By reducing the number of categories, patterns in regional disadvantage become much easier to interpret.\n\n\n# Obtain top 10 areas by respondent count\ntop_areas &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;%\n  count(area) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, n) %&gt;%\n  pull(area)\n\n# Filter to these areas for cleaner plot\nscottish_top_areas &lt;- filter(scottish1, area %in% top_areas)\n\nggplot(scottish_top_areas, aes(x = as.factor(area), y = age_years, fill = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7, draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age Distribution (Top 10 Areas) by Sex\",\n    subtitle = \"Only top 10 by respondent count for visualization clarity\",\n    x = \"Geographic Area Code\",\n    y = \"Age (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Age distributions are broadly similar across different geographic areas, with both sexes represented through the entire age range. Most areas display a wide age span, indicating demographic diversity and a lack of strong age stratification within any one region. No clear regional patterns emerge suggesting systematic differences in the age structure of the population by geographic area.\n\n\nset.seed(42)\nscottish_sample &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;% group_by(social_class) %&gt;% sample_n(size = 200, replace = FALSE)\n\nggplot(scottish_sample, aes(x = deprivation_score, y = as.factor(social_class), color = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.6, size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampled Points: Deprivation by Social Class\",\n    x = \"Carstairs Deprivation Score\",\n    y = \"Social Class\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Lower social classes are more likely to have higher deprivation scores, but all social classes contain individuals across a wide range of neighborhood affluence and deprivation. The overlap in distributions across classes highlights that individual socioeconomic status and area-level deprivation are related but not perfectly aligned for all respondents.\n\nscottish1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(cvd_diagnosed = as.factor(cvd_diagnosed)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = social_class, fill = cvd_diagnosed)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\", labels = c(\"No CVD\", \"CVD\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"CVD Prevalence by Social Class\",\n    subtitle = \"Proportion of respondents with diagnosed CVD within each social class\",\n    x = \"Social Class\",\n    y = \"Proportion\",\n    fill = \"CVD Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: This stacked bar chart (proportion format) directly compares CVD prevalence across social classes. The visualization reveals whether lower social classes show higher proportions of CVD diagnosis, confirming socioeconomic gradients in cardiovascular health. If the red (CVD) portion is noticeably larger in lower social classes, it demonstrates health inequality patterns. This plot effectively summarizes how cardiovascular disease burden is distributed across socioeconomic groups in Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\ntable_sex_cvd &lt;- xtabs(~ respondent_sex + cvd_diagnosed, data = scottish1)\nvcd::mosaic(table_sex_cvd,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Sex vs CVD Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The mosaic plot illustrates the relationship between sex and CVD diagnosis. The shading indicates whether observed frequencies deviate from expected frequencies under independence. Blue shading suggests fewer CVD cases than expected, while red shading indicates more cases than expected. The relative widths show the proportion of males versus females in the sample, while heights within each sex category show CVD prevalence. Any significant deviations from expected frequencies suggest an association between sex and CVD risk.\n\n\ntable_smoke_cvd &lt;- xtabs(~ smoking_status + cvd_diagnosed, data = scottish1)\nvcd::mosaic(table_smoke_cvd,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Smoking Status vs CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: This mosaic plot reveals the association between smoking status and CVD diagnosis. The relative widths of the smoking status categories show their prevalence in the population, while the heights within each category indicate CVD prevalence. Residual shading highlights cells where observed frequencies significantly deviate from what would be expected if smoking and CVD were independent. Strong blue or red shading in certain smoking-CVD combinations indicates protective or risk associations, respectively, confirming smoking as a cardiovascular risk factor.\n\n\ntable_sex_sc &lt;- xtabs(~ respondent_sex + social_class, data = scottish1)\nvcd::mosaic(table_sex_sc,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Sex vs Social Class\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The mosaic plot demonstrates balanced representation of both sexes within each social class. Minimal shading indicates that observed frequencies closely match expected frequencies, suggesting independence between sex and socioeconomic status in this survey. This confirms that the survey design successfully captured both males and females across all social class categories without systematic gender bias in any particular socioeconomic group.\n\n\nscottish_table &lt;- xtabs(~ respondent_sex + smoking_status + cvd_diagnosed, data = scottish1)\n\nvcd::mosaic(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Observed Frequencies - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The three-way observed frequencies mosaic plot shows the actual distribution of respondents across sex, smoking status, and CVD diagnosis categories. The plot is divided first by sex, then by smoking status within each sex, and finally by CVD diagnosis within each smoking-sex combination. The shading indicates standardized residuals—cells with strong red coloring indicate combinations that occur more frequently than expected under complete independence of all three variables, while blue indicates less frequent combinations. This reveals which specific combinations of sex, smoking behavior, and CVD diagnosis are over- or under-represented in the Scottish population.\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            type = \"expected\",\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Expected Frequencies - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The expected frequencies mosaic plot illustrates how respondents would be distributed across sex, smoking status, and CVD categories if all three variables were completely independent of one another. This plot serves as a baseline for comparison with the observed frequencies. Any differences between this expected plot and the observed plot reveal associations between the variables. Equal-sized divisions within categories in this plot indicate what pure independence would look like, highlighting how different real-world patterns are from statistical independence.\n\n\nvcd::assoc(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Association - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The association plot directly visualizes the deviations between observed and expected frequencies across all sex-smoking-CVD combinations. The height and shading of each bar represent the magnitude and direction of the residual (observed minus expected). Tall red bars indicate combinations that occur much more frequently than expected, suggesting positive associations or elevated risk patterns (e.g., male current smokers with CVD). Tall blue bars extending downward indicate combinations occurring less than expected, suggesting protective effects or negative associations. This plot effectively highlights which specific combinations of sex, smoking status, and CVD diagnosis show the strongest departures from independence, helping identify key risk factors and protective patterns in the Scottish population.\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis explores cardiovascular disease patterns in the Scottish adult population from the 1998 Health Survey. The data reveals important associations between CVD prevalence and key risk factors including age, sex, smoking status, social class, and area deprivation. Key findings include:\n\nAge distributions are balanced across sex and social class, with no systematic age-related sampling bias\nSmoking status shows distinct age patterns, with former smokers tending to be older\nGeographic areas differ substantially in deprivation scores, revealing regional socioeconomic inequalities\nIndividual social class and area-level deprivation show expected but imperfect alignment\nCVD prevalence varies by social class, confirming socioeconomic health gradients\nSmoking status shows strong association with CVD diagnosis, as expected from epidemiological research\n\nThese findings underscore the multifactorial nature of cardiovascular disease and the persistence of socioeconomic health inequalities in Scotland, providing evidence to guide public health policy and targeted intervention strategies."

    "text": "These frequency tables reveal the distribution of observations across smoking categories and CVD diagnosis. CVD prevalence appears relatively low in this sample, while smoking status shows diverse patterns across the population.\n\nNext, we checked patterns across social class and smoking:\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(y = smoking_status, x = age_years, fill = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot of Smoking Status by Age and Sex\",\n    subtitle = \"Examining smoking categories by age distributions and gender\",\n    y = \"Smoking Status\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The boxplot reveals distinct age patterns across smoking status categories. Former smokers tend to be older on average, while current smokers show a wider age distribution. The patterns are largely consistent between males and females, suggesting similar smoking behavior trajectories across genders. Never-smokers show a broad age range, indicating that non-smoking is prevalent across all adult age groups.\n\n\nscottish1 &lt;- scottish1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(smoking_status = as.factor(smoking_status))\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(x = age_years, y = smoking_status, fill = smoking_status)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Age by Smoking Status\",\n    subtitle = \"Ridge Plot showing age patterns across smoking categories\",\n    x = \"Age (Years)\",\n    y = \"Smoking Status\",\n    fill = \"Smoking Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 3.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The ridgeline plot provides a clear visualization of how age distributions vary across different smoking status categories. Each smoking category shows its own distinct age profile, with overlapping curves indicating areas where multiple smoking behaviors are common at similar ages. Some categories show bimodal distributions, suggesting different age-related patterns of smoking initiation, continuation, or cessation within the Scottish population.\n\n\nggplot(scottish1, aes(x = social_class, y = age_years, fill = respondent_sex, color = respondent_sex)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7, draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Violin Plot of Age by Social Class and Sex\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution shapes with quartile lines\",\n    x = \"Social Class\",\n    y = \"Age (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Sex\",\n    color = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\nWarning: The `draw_quantiles` argument of `geom_violin()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n4.0.0.\nℹ Please use the `quantiles.linetype` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Age distributions across social class categories show minimal variation, with all three social classes having similar median ages and spreads. This indicates that social class in this sample is not strongly age-dependent, and the survey captured individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds across the full adult age range. Both males and females show comparable patterns within each social class."

Some codes or groups show consistently higher median deprivation, indicating more disadvantaged populations; others indicate lower median deprivation and greater affluence. Socioeconomic heterogeneity is visible within most regions, reflecting the mix of affluent and deprived communities present even in the same geographic area.

The visualization reveals whether lower social classes show higher proportions of CVD diagnosis, confirming socioeconomic gradients in cardiovascular health. If the red (CVD) portion is noticeably larger in lower social classes, it demonstrates health inequality patterns. This plot effectively summarizes how cardiovascular disease burden is distributed across socioeconomic groups in Scotland."

The shading indicates whether observed frequencies deviate from expected frequencies under independence. Blue shading suggests fewer CVD cases than expected, while red shading indicates more cases than expected. The relative widths show the proportion of males versus females in the sample, while heights within each sex category show CVD prevalence. Any significant deviations from expected frequencies suggest an association between sex and CVD risk.\n\n\ntable_smoke_cvd &lt;- xtabs(~ smoking_status + cvd_diagnosed, data = scottish1)\nvcd::mosaic(table_smoke_cvd,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Smoking Status vs CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: This mosaic plot reveals the association between smoking status and CVD diagnosis. The relative widths of the smoking status categories show their prevalence in the population, while the heights within each category indicate CVD prevalence. Residual shading highlights cells where observed frequencies significantly deviate from what would be expected if smoking and CVD were independent. Strong blue or red shading in certain smoking-CVD combinations indicates protective or risk associations, respectively, confirming smoking as a cardiovascular risk factor.\n\n\ntable_sex_sc &lt;- xtabs(~ respondent_sex + social_class, data = scottish1)\nvcd::mosaic(table_sex_sc,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Sex vs Social Class\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The mosaic plot demonstrates balanced representation of both sexes within each social class. Minimal shading indicates that observed frequencies closely match expected frequencies, suggesting independence between sex and socioeconomic status in this survey. This confirms that the survey design successfully captured both males and females across all social class categories without systematic gender bias in any particular socioeconomic group.\n\n\nscottish_table &lt;- xtabs(~ respondent_sex + smoking_status + cvd_diagnosed, data = scottish1)\n\nvcd::mosaic(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Observed Frequencies - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The three-way observed frequencies mosaic plot shows the actual distribution of respondents across sex, smoking status, and CVD diagnosis categories. The plot is divided first by sex, then by smoking status within each sex, and finally by CVD diagnosis within each smoking-sex combination. The shading indicates standardized residuals—cells with strong red coloring indicate combinations that occur more frequently than expected under complete independence of all three variables, while blue indicates less frequent combinations. This reveals which specific combinations of sex, smoking behavior, and CVD diagnosis are over- or under-represented in the Scottish population.\n\n\nvcd::mosaic(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            type = \"expected\",\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Expected Frequencies - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The expected frequencies mosaic plot illustrates how respondents would be distributed across sex, smoking status, and CVD categories if all three variables were completely independent of one another. This plot serves as a baseline for comparison with the observed frequencies. Any differences between this expected plot and the observed plot reveal associations between the variables. Equal-sized divisions within categories in this plot indicate what pure independence would look like, highlighting how different real-world patterns are from statistical independence.\n\n\nvcd::assoc(scottish_table,\n            shade = TRUE,\n            legend = TRUE,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot: Association - Sex, Smoking, and CVD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The association plot directly visualizes the deviations between observed and expected frequencies across all sex-smoking-CVD combinations. The height and shading of each bar represent the magnitude and direction of the residual (observed minus expected). Tall red bars indicate combinations that occur much more frequently than expected, suggesting positive associations or elevated risk patterns (e.g., male current smokers with CVD). Tall blue bars extending downward indicate combinations occurring less than expected, suggesting protective effects or negative associations. This plot effectively highlights which specific combinations of sex, smoking status, and CVD diagnosis show the strongest departures from independence, helping identify key risk factors and protective patterns in the Scottish population."

    "text": "This analysis explores cardiovascular disease patterns in the Scottish adult population from the 1998 Health Survey. The data reveals important associations between CVD prevalence and key risk factors including age, sex, smoking status, social class, and area deprivation. Key findings include:\n\nAge distributions are balanced across sex and social class, with no systematic age-related sampling bias\nSmoking status shows distinct age patterns, with former smokers tending to be older\nGeographic areas differ substantially in deprivation scores, revealing regional socioeconomic inequalities\nIndividual social class and area-level deprivation show expected but imperfect alignment\nCVD prevalence varies by social class, confirming socioeconomic health gradients\nSmoking status shows strong association with CVD diagnosis, as expected from epidemiological research\n\nThese findings underscore the multifactorial nature of cardiovascular disease and the persistence of socioeconomic health inequalities in Scotland, providing evidence to guide public health policy and targeted intervention strategies."

The results were:\n\nWages_mod2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(language) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wages = mean(wages, na.rm=T),\n            education = mean(education), \n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  language wages education count\n  &lt;fct&gt;

This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."

The gender gap is less pronounced among teens, and outliers suggest exceptional cases (e.g,, maybe they work in family business or have specialized work).\nTo see if our assumptions made about retirement were true, we filtered the individuals aged 60 and above.

    "text": "From our exploratory analysis, it is clear that the gender wage gap persists regardless of language or educational attainment, suggesting that systemic factors outweigh individual qualifications.\nWhile women’s earnings peak in their 30s-40s, they plateau or decline afterward, whereas men’s wages continue to rise steadily into their 50s and 60s, benefiting from seniority and career progression. This long-term divergence points to structural barriers in advancement opportunities for women rather than simple workforce exits.\nThe pronounced gap within the “Other” language group further suggests that migrant women may be concentrated in lower-paying roles, while men access higher wages. Although the data set does not capture working hours, which could explain some of the disparity through part-time or reduced work linked to family responsibilities, the overall trend shows women consistently earning at low to mid-level wages across their lives.\nIn contrast, men not only remain in the workforce longer but also continue to progress into higher-paying senior roles, reinforcing the persistent wage divide."
